# [LANGGRAPH-REACT-AGENT-STUDIO ARCHITECTURE EXTENSION DOC](./ARCHITECTURE_DESCRIPTION_EXTENDING.md)

## Instructions

*  "**You cannot edit this file**". But yo must read it, analize it, ask for clarification and wait authrorization. Any alternative proposed to it that optmimize and enhance its performance by leveraging at maximun gemini-cli can be presented as a separate file."

## Tasks

* "Create a detailed implementation plan for [DOCUMENTING]" this codebase.
* Create multiple hierarchical GEMINI md files defining 
  * Base Architecture
  * Architecture Key Components Role
  * Frontend Extension
  * Backend Extension
    * New Databases
    * LLM Routing / Selector
  * Helpful code snippets for extending the architecture. 
  * If a radical Architecture enhancement is desiderable, jsutify clearly its justification, benefits from it
* Collaboration >> YOLO. I don't use a "YOLO mode" and rather intercept and re-prompt.
* Use MCP servers to access 
  * File content
  * Bugs
  * Issues
  * Browsers
  * Github (& internal tools)
  * Run code in sandboxes.
* Leverage the 1M Context. Instruct it to read a lot of files into context or use “@” primitives.
* Code → Test → Commit. I force it to write tests or execute code snippets and have it fix it in a loop.
