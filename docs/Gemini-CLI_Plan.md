# âœ¦ Okay, I have read and understood the ARCHITECTURE_DESCRIPTION_EXTENDING.md file. I will adhere to its instructions, including not editing that file.

  Here is the detailed implementation plan for documenting this codebase:

# Phase 1: Architecture Understanding & Documentation Planning

   1. **Understand Base Architecture:**
       * Read README.md for a high-level overview.
       * Examine docker-compose.yml and Dockerfile to understand the deployment setup.
       * Review backend/pyproject.toml and frontend/package.json for dependencies and project structure.
       * Analyze backend/src/agent/app.py, backend/src/agent/chatbot_graph.py, backend/src/agent/state.py, and backend/src/agent/tools_and_schemas.py to grasp the core LangGraph agent implementation.
       * Examine frontend/src/App.tsx, frontend/src/main.tsx, and frontend/src/components/ to understand the React frontend structure and component interactions.
       * Review frontend/src/lib/agents.ts, frontend/src/lib/models.ts, frontend/src/types/ for frontend data structures and API interactions.

   2. **Define Content for Hierarchical GEMINI MD Files:**
       * `docs/architecture/base_architecture.md`: Describe the overall system, its components (frontend, backend, database), and how they interact. Include a high-level data flow.
       * `docs/architecture/key_components_role.md`: Detail the purpose and responsibilities of key modules/files identified in Phase 1 (e.g., chatbot_graph.py, state.py, App.tsx, ChatMessagesView.tsx).
       * `docs/extension/frontend_extension.md`: Provide guidance on adding new UI components, integrating with new backend endpoints, and extending existing frontend logic.
       * `docs/extension/backend_extension.md`:
           * `docs/extension/backend_extension/new_databases.md`: Explain how to integrate new databases (e.g., adding new ORM models, connection configurations).
           * `docs/extension/backend_extension/llm_routing_selector.md`: Describe how to implement or extend LLM routing/selection logic within the LangGraph agent.
       * `docs/extension/helpful_code_snippets.md`: Collect and present reusable code examples for common extension tasks (e.g., adding a new tool, creating a new agent state, making an API call from frontend).

   3. **Identify Radical Architecture Enhancements (Optional but will consider):**
       * During the understanding phase, I will look for opportunities for significant architectural improvements (e.g., microservices, message queues, advanced caching). If identified, I will propose them in a separate file with clear justification and benefits.

# Phase 2: Documentation Generation & Refinement

   1. **Create Directory Structure**: Create the docs/architecture/ and docs/extension/ directories.
   2. **Generate Content**: Write the content for each markdown file based on the understanding gained in Phase 1. I will use @ primitives to read relevant files into context as needed.
   3. **Review and Refine**: Ensure clarity, accuracy, and completeness of all documentation. Check for consistency in terminology and formatting.
   4. **Code Snippets**: Extract and format relevant code snippets, ensuring they are easy to understand and apply.
   5. **Self-Correction/Verification**: I will use run_shell_command to verify file paths and existence, and read_file to confirm content as I generate it.

# Phase 3: Verification & Commit

   1. **Linting/Formatting**: If applicable, run any project-specific linting or formatting tools on the new markdown files (I will check package.json or pyproject.toml for relevant scripts).
   2. **Commit**: Stage and commit the new documentation files with a clear and concise commit message.

  I will now proceed with Phase 1, starting with understanding the existing architecture. I will begin by reading the README.md file.
